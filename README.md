- Loaded the dataset.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Performed preprocessing tasks, such as handling null values and removing unnecessary attributes.
- Separated the features and target attributes, followed by splitting the dataset into a 70-30 ratio for training and testing.
- Applied the following machine learning models:
  - Extreme Gradient Boosting Mode
  - Logistic Regressor Mode
  - K-nearest neighbor Model
  - Naive Bayes Model
  - RandomForest Model
